<h1> 3D Image Reconstruction Project </h1>
<h2>Contributors: Shubh Patel, Tejas Patel</h2>

<h3><mark>Overview</mark></h3>
<p>This deep learning project focuses on reconstructing 3D objects from 2D images captured from different angles. The goal is to take multiple 2D images of an object and reconstruct its 3D shape using advanced deep learning techniques. This project explores the potential of bridging the gap between 2D visual data and 3D object reconstruction, which has a wide range of applications in areas such as Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), gaming, robotics, and 3D printing.</p>

<h3><mark>Problem Statement</mark></h3>
<p>Most of the visual data captured in our daily life, such as images or videos, are in 2D, while objects exist in 3D. Bridging this gap allows for the creation of more realistic models for AR/VR applications, gaming environments, robotics, and more. Additionally, this technology can be applied to 3D printing, where a 2D image can generate a 3D model ready for printing, removing the need for manually creating 3D models in software like Blender.</p>

<h3><mark>Dataset</mark></h3>
<p>For this project, we are utilizing the Pix3D dataset, which contains 2D images and corresponding 3D models in .obj format. The dataset includes 9 different categories of objects, such as:
<ul>

<li>Bed</li>
<li>Bookcase</li>
<li>Chair</li>
<li>And more...</li>
</ul>
Each object has multiple 2D images taken from different angles, along with a 3D model to serve as the ground truth for reconstruction.
